Hi, I'm Adonijah! 
As a Research & Development Mechanical Engineer at Ampersand Energy, I significantly contribute to innovation in E-moto production and service. I play a key role in the design, testing, and optimization of critical motorbike components, consistently delivering prototypes that advance efficiency and performance through the application of cutting-edge technologies. My work directly contributes to accelerating the E-mobility sector across Sub-Saharan Africa, where I actively research and implement solutions that define the future of sustainable transportation.


My passion for empowering the next generation of African engineers aligns perfectly with my active involvement in building the continent's first scalable hardware innovation ecosystem in Kigali. I'm fostering an environment where innovation thrives, particularly at the intersection of data and hardware.



Beyond my core engineering role, my leadership extends to shaping the future of the profession globally. As an Ordinary Member of the IMechE Nominations Committee (NomCo) and a Young Members Board Representative for IMechE, I directly influence leadership selection, champion emerging talent, and foster best practices across the engineering community.



My experience developing and leading EngiClinics, a mechanical product design service provider, further underscores my ability to spearhead initiatives, lead qualified engineering teams, and deliver high-quality design solutions for clients. With a Master's in Data Science and a robust foundation in Mechanical Engineering, complemented by certifications in design, I'm strategically positioned to leverage my expertise in engineering design, data-driven R&D, process optimization, and production intelligence to achieve significant business growth and impactful social change across Africa.As a Research & Development Mechanical Engineer at Ampersand Energy, I significantly contribute to innovation in E-moto production and service.
